# Producer-Consumer-Synchronization
The aim of this project is to develop a practical understanding of task collaboration using socket programming, semaphores, and multithreading.
The system is a data processing system to process strings of characters. It replaces all instances of lowercase vowels with uppercase ones and 
appends to the last set of strings the sum of all numbers found.

## Synchronization
The semaphore and mutex are used to ensure mutual exclusion and synchronization when more that one thread tries to access the critical region.
